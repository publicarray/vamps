1. Ensure you have libdvdread installed. V0.9.4 is known to work Ok.

2. "make"
   This should not produce any warnings or errors. If you run into any
   problem - try your best.

3. "make install" as root will copy vamps and play_cell to /usr/local/bin.
   Modify the Makefile for a different location.
